## Concentration-App-in-iOS

This is an implementation of the Concentration app used to introduce students to Swift in the Stanford course ['Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift'](https://podcasts.apple.com/ru/podcast/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1315130780?l=en&mt=2). It plays the game [Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)).
